# Ian Dorion 👋  
**Software Engineer · Security · Distributed Systems · Web3 Infrastructure**

I design and ship **privacy-first, security-critical systems** at the intersection of
distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain infrastructure.

My work focuses on **reducing systemic risk** in production environments —
whether that’s preventing missed on-chain events, eliminating brittle architectures,
or replacing complexity with principled design.

## 🔐 Focus Areas
- Application & protocol security
- Cryptography & key management
- Distributed systems & event-driven architectures
- Smart contracts, DeFi & cross-chain infrastructure
- Privacy-first wallet connectivity and authentication

---

## 🚀 Flagship Work
- **QuantumAuth** — Privacy-first Web3 authentication & wallet connectivity  
  → Transparent connectors, no third-party relays, security by design

- **Blockchain Indexing & Reliability**  
  → Production-grade indexers ensuring complete on-chain event coverage

- **DeFi Infrastructure**  
  → Token-less yield farming, broker-managed DeFi workflows

---

## 🌍 Open Source & Community
- **Compound Finance** — Reported oracle manipulation vulnerability
- **Ethereum Magicians** — Wallet security, privacy models, post-quantum signatures
- **GitHub Desktop** — IntelliJ IDEA integration
- **OpenZeppelin Community** — Smart contract security discussions

---

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
- Security is a **system property**, not a feature
- Simplicity beats cleverness in production
- Transparency builds trust — obscurity builds risk
- Architecture decisions outlive code
